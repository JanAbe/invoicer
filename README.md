#### Documentation

The project has a hexagonal architecture:
![Hexagonal architecture](./resources/images/hexagonal_architecture.png)

The adapter hexagon contains classes that transform incoming data to a format
that is understood by the application. At the moment there are only adapter classes
for the Inter-Process-Communication (IPC) port, but new ones could be added if needed
in the future. For example if a decision is made to also expose our app via REST.

The application hexagon contains the services the application provides.

The domain hexagon contains all domain classes and business-rules.

Parameters, constructors, getters, setters and types have been left out, as they clutter the diagram.
