Have the idea that a lot of time is spent of transforming incoming
data into rich domain objects, only to transform them back into data to persist 'em

Should client and equipmentItem be an entity if i want to give the user the option
to create, delete, update, read these objects, or are they value objects

Why does an aggregate hold the id of another entity?
in my experience when you ask for the aggregate, you also want the data from it's entities.
You don't have these because you only got the ID pointing to the entity, which means you have to
make another call to the database to retrieve these. This sounds inefficient.

So when, how and where do you use DTO's. Do you change incoming data into a DTO, which you then transform into
a domain object, which then gets persisted? 
Do you create a domain object from the db, which later gets transformed into a DTO, which gets sent back to
the user? Or do you create a DTO immediately when fetching data from the database?

How to deal with the fact that if user-info changes, and a user of the app
views an older invoice, the displayed information of this old invoice is actually not
the same as it was when it was created. Because invoice has a connection to a user table
and it doesn't have the user-info as part of its own table.
    Do i just also add all user-info fields also to the invoice table?
