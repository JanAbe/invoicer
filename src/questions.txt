have the idea that a lot of time is spent of transforming incoming
data into rich domain objects, only to transform them back into data to persist 'em

should client and equipmentItem be an entity if i want to give the user the option
to create, delete, update, read these objects, or are they value objects

why does an aggregate hold the id of another entity?
in my experience when you ask for the aggregate, you also want the data from it's entities.
You don't have these because you only got the ID pointing to the entity, which means you have to
make another call to the database to retrieve these. This sounds inefficient.
